Problem Statement
In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
Should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explanation:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.

Solution :

select distinct foo.follower, c.count num 
from follow foo 
    join (select
            a.followee, count(distinct follower) count 
         from 
            follow a 
         group by a.followee) c
on (foo.follower = c.followee)
order by foo.follower
